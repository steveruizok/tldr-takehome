# tldraw take-home challenge

This is a take home challenge for an apprenticeship with tldraw, a tiny little drawing app.

The brief was to implement a sticker feature as below using React, although this was later changed to Vanilla JS. However, I was already deep into the React version and was enjoying the challenge of it, so I chose to see it through in React.

## Assumptions

- Since I'm not working with a team, it isn't necessary to make branches for features I'm working on.
- However my commits should be small, discrete and frequent in order to tell a legible story of the development of the project to my potential employers. (Hello!)
- I'll need to follow the reference very closely and try to implement all the features I see.

## Stretch user stories

As a user I want to be able to resize emojis I've placed

As a user I want to be able to select skin tones that match my own

As a user I want to be able to select from a broader range of emojis

As a user I want to be able to delete stickers I've placed. This is the one I chose.
